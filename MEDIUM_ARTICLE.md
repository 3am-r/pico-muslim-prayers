## The Spark of an Idea

It was during a particularly busy Ramadan when the idea hit me. As a Muslim developer, I found myself constantly checking my phone for prayer times, Hijri dates, and Islamic events. Between work meetings, family time, and the hustle of daily life, I sometimes missed prayer notifications buried in a sea of other alerts.

"What if," I thought, "there was a dedicated device that did nothing but help me stay connected to my Islamic obligations?"

That simple question sparked a six-week journey that would take me deep into hardware programming, Islamic astronomical calculations, and user interface design. This is the story of how **Muslim Companion** came to life.

## Chapter 1: The Vision Takes Shape

### Starting with Purpose

The vision was clear: create a dedicated Islamic companion device that would:
- Display accurate prayer times for any location
- Show the current Hijri date and upcoming Islamic events
- Provide audio alerts for prayer times
- Offer an intuitive interface that anyone could use
- Be completely offline and always accessible

But vision is one thing‚Äîexecution is another entirely.

### Choosing the Right Hardware

After researching various options, I settled on the **Raspberry Pi Pico 2 W** with a **GeeekPi GPIO Expansion Module**. Here's why:

- **Pico 2 W**: Powerful enough for complex calculations, WiFi-capable for future updates, incredibly energy-efficient
- **3.5" Touch Screen**: Large enough for clear prayer time displays, small enough for desk/bedside placement
- **Physical Controls**: Joystick and buttons for navigation without always needing to touch the screen
- **Audio Feedback**: Built-in buzzer for prayer alerts

The hardware cost? Under $100. The learning experience? Priceless.

## Chapter 2: The Technical Deep Dive

### Wrestling with MicroPython

My first challenge was getting comfortable with **MicroPython** on embedded hardware. Coming from traditional Python development, I had to unlearn some habits:

```python
# This doesn't work in MicroPython the way you'd expect
import sys
sys.path.append('lib')  # Had to be done in boot.py
```

The solution was creating a modular architecture where each component lived in its own file:

```
lib/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ prayer_times.py    # Islamic prayer calculations
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ hijri_calendar.py  # Hijri date conversion
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ ui_manager.py      # Touch interface
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ geekpi_gpio.py     # Hardware abstraction
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ prayer_settings.py # Configuration management
```

### The Prayer Time Challenge

Here's where things got mathematically interesting. Calculating Islamic prayer times isn't as simple as "sunrise + offset." It requires:

- **Astronomical calculations** for sun position
- **Geographic coordinates** and timezone handling  
- **Different calculation methods** (ISNA, Muslim World League, etc.)
- **Seasonal variations** and daylight saving time

I spent three days debugging why my Asr prayer time was showing 21:31 instead of the expected 17:00. The issue? I was using a simplified algorithm instead of proper astronomical calculations.

```python
def calculate_asr_time(self, transit, declination):
    # Asr occurs when shadow length = object length + 1
    # This requires solving complex trigonometry
    shadow_factor = 1 + (1 if self.asr_madhab == 1 else 2)
    angle = math.degrees(math.atan(1.0 / shadow_factor))
    # ... more complex calculations
```

### Hijri Date Conversion: A Historical Puzzle

Converting Gregorian dates to Hijri proved even more challenging. The Islamic calendar is lunar-based, with months varying between 29-30 days. Pure algorithmic conversion can be off by days.

My solution? A hybrid approach using reference dates:

```python
# Reference dates for accuracy
reference_dates = [
    (2025, 9, 4, 1447, 3, 12),  # Sep 4, 2025 = Rabi' I 12, 1447
    # More reference points...
]
```

## Chapter 3: The Interface Evolution

### From Console to Touchscreen

My first working version was just console output‚Äîprayer times printed to the terminal. Functional, but hardly inspiring.

The transformation to a touchscreen interface was where the magic happened:

![Navigation Interface](prtsc/PICO_MUSLIM_PRAYERS_3.jpg)

### Mobile-First Design Philosophy

I drew inspiration from modern mobile apps, implementing:

- **Bottom navigation tabs** (Prayer Times, Hijri Events, Settings)
- **Touch-friendly buttons** with proper spacing
- **Swipe gestures** for navigation
- **Visual feedback** for all interactions

The key insight? Make it feel familiar. Muslims using this device shouldn't need to learn a new interface paradigm.

### The ASCII Art Challenge

One unexpected challenge was displaying icons. Unicode emojis (üïåüìÖ‚öôÔ∏è) showed as question marks on the display. My solution? Custom ASCII art:

```
Prayer Tab:     Events Tab:     Settings Tab:
   _^_             ===               +-+
   |O|             |1|               |O|
   |_|             ---               +-+
```

Simple, recognizable, and perfectly compatible with the display's character set.

## Chapter 4: The Details That Matter

### Time Format Preferences

A seemingly simple feature request‚Äî"Can it show 12-hour time?"‚Äîled to a complete refactor of the time display system. Every prayer time, current time display, and countdown needed to respect the user's preference.

```python
def format_time(self, time_str, include_seconds=True):
    if self.config.get('time_format') == '12h':
        # Convert to 12-hour format with AM/PM
        # Handle edge cases, midnight, noon, etc.
```

### Hardware Abstraction for the Future

Knowing that others might want to use different hardware, I built in vendor abstraction from the start:

```python
# hardware_config.py
HARDWARE_VENDOR = 'geekpi'  # Easy to change

def get_hardware():
    if HARDWARE_VENDOR == 'geekpi':
        return GeeekPiHardware()
    # Future: Waveshare, custom hardware...
```

This means the core application can work with different GPIO expansion modules just by changing one configuration line.

## Chapter 5: The User Experience Refinements

### Navigation Consistency

Users expected to navigate the same way across all screens. This meant:
- **Touch navigation** works everywhere
- **Joystick controls** work everywhere  
- **Physical buttons** have consistent behavior
- **Audio feedback** confirms every action

### Performance Optimization

A 60-frame-per-second interface this isn't, but careful optimizations made it feel responsive:

```python
def update_time_only(self):
    # Only redraw the time, not the entire screen
    if self.current_tab == 'prayer':
        self.ui.update_time_display(formatted_time)
```

### The Settings Screen Challenge

The most complex UI challenge was the settings screen. It needed to:
- Support joystick navigation (up/down/select)
- Handle touch input for direct selection
- Provide visual feedback for the selected item
- Allow tab switching from within settings

The breakthrough came when I realized settings shouldn't block the main application loop‚Äîit should integrate seamlessly with the navigation system.

## Chapter 6: Islamic Accuracy and Cultural Sensitivity

### Getting the Details Right

This wasn't just a technical project‚Äîit was a tool for religious observance. Every detail mattered:

- **Prayer time accuracy** within minutes, not hours
- **Proper Islamic event names** and dates
- **Multiple calculation methods** for different communities
- **Respectful terminology** throughout the interface

### Community Feedback Integration

I tested with Muslim friends and family, gathering feedback on:
- Prayer time accuracy for our local area
- Interface clarity and ease of use  
- Islamic event coverage and naming
- Audio alert timing and duration

Their input shaped features I never would have considered, like:
- Configurable alert duration (some prefer longer reminders)
- Support for different calculation madhabs
- Clear indication of which prayer is currently active

## Chapter 7: The Technical Architecture

### Modular Design Principles

The final architecture follows clean separation of concerns:

```python
class MuslimCompanion:
    def __init__(self):
        self.hw = get_hardware()           # Hardware abstraction
        self.prayer_calc = PrayerTimes()   # Islamic calculations  
        self.hijri_calendar = HijriCalendar()  # Calendar system
        self.ui = UIManager()              # Interface management
        self.settings = PrayerSettings()   # Configuration
```

Each module handles its own responsibility, making the codebase maintainable and extensible.

### Error Handling and Resilience

Embedded systems need to handle errors gracefully:

```python
while True:
    try:
        # Main application loop
        self.handle_input()
        self.update_display()
    except Exception as e:
        print(f"Error: {e}")
        # Continue running, don't crash
        time.sleep(1)
```

The device should never crash because of a calculation error or input glitch.

## Chapter 8: Lessons Learned

### Technical Insights

1. **Hardware abstraction pays dividends** - Building for multiple hardware configurations from day one saved countless hours later
2. **User testing is irreplaceable** - No amount of personal testing replaces real user feedback
3. **Performance matters on embedded systems** - Every screen update and memory allocation counts
4. **Islamic calculations are complex** - Astronomical algorithms require precision and cultural awareness

### Development Philosophy

The most important lesson? **Start with the user experience, not the technology.**

I could have built a complex system with web interfaces, mobile apps, and cloud synchronization. Instead, I focused on solving the core problem: providing reliable, always-accessible Islamic prayer information.
